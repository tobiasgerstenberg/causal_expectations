- `code/R/`: analysis code
	+ the analysis code can be viewed directly [here](https://tobiasgerstenberg.github.io/causal_expectations/index.html)
- `code/experiments/`: experiment code
	+ experiments were run using [psiturk](https://psiturk.org/)
- `data/`: contains the participant data base 
- `figures/`: diagram and results figure 
- `videos/`: video of each type of clip shown to participants; note that in the experiment, the position of the balls and the positions of the blocks was counterbalanced (e.g. for some participants, ball A was at the top and ball B at the bottom, and vice versa for other participants)
